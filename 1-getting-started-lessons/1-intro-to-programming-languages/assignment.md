## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

1.Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade css extension language in the world	| When you install Sass on the command line, you'll be able to run the sass executable to compile .sass and .scss files to .css files. For example:sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css First install Sass using one of the options below, then run sass --version to be sure it installed correctly. If it did, this will include 1.55.0. You can also run sass --help for more information about the command-line interface.| https://sass-lang.com/documentation/  |
|2.Boots. Do you want to build a website without spending a lot of time on CSS? Then this tool is precisely what you need. |As a framework, Bootstrap includes the basics for responsive web development, so developers only need to insert the code into a pre-defined grid system. The Bootstrap framework is built on Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. Web developers using Bootstrap can build websites much faster without spending time worrying about basic commands and functions. | https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/
